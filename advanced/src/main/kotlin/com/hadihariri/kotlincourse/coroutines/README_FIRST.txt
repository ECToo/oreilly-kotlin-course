Coroutines API have changed somewhat from the time this course was made.
The examples as such won't align with the course segment, although the general
idea still remains. I'll be updating the examples with new ones. In the meantime
for coroutines, make sure you check out https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines
